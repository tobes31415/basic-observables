# Basic-Observables

A lightweight implementation of the observable pattern.

This is meant to cover many of the common needs so that you don't always need to reach for larger libraries at the start. The syntax is compatible with a particularly well know asynchrounous event library, so when your application grows to the point you need all those extra features you can seamlessly transition without having to rewrite your code, just change your imports.
